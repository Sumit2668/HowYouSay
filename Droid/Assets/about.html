<h1>Why We Made "How You Say"</h1>

<p>In the summer of 2015, my wife, Angie, our eldest daughter Maddie, and I headed to Europe. For the first part we volunteered at a kid&#8217;s camp in Gjakova, Kosovo with Service International. After that, Angie and I celebrated our 20th year of marriage in Sorrento and Rome, Italy. </p>

<p>I love languages, and what it teaches us about the way people think and communicate. I couldn&#8217;t find any really good apps or resources for Albanian, the dominant language in Kosovo, so I built one. I needed something to quickly capture vocabulary and document how to say it. </p>

<p>Because I couldn&#8217;t go to a reference book, or website, the people I met became my source. I hadn&#8217;t anticipated just how rich and rewarding that would be. It completely changed how I view language learning. Over the course of 3 weeks, I captured dozens of words and phrases, both in text and audio, and rapidly modified the app to be as useful as possible. And oh how useful it was.</p>

<p>From this trip came &#8220;How You Say&#8221;. The emphasis is on learning language (and culture) through engaging local speakers. Real people. It doesn&#8217;t give you a computer translation. You don&#8217;t get a computer pronounciation. You get the people you record, and each recording takes you right back to that person, that conversion, and that setting. </p>

<p>How You Say promotes curiosity and encourages you to be inquisitive in order to build a working vocabulary. It is your personal language journal.</p>

<p>Give it an honest try. I think you&#8217;ll really love it. </p>
